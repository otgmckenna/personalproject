# Personal Project for DTC 115 - Introduction to Data Analytics
Repository for my personal project for DATA 115 - Introduction to Data Analytics at Washington State University.

With this project, I set out to find the answer to the question: "What is the most important social media app?" Obviously, though, it's not as easy as you might think to answer a question like that.

Acquiring the data for this project was made possible through the use of data.world and their collection of relevant datasets pertaining to social media use in a wide range of settings and audiences. Going in, I knew if I wanted this data analysis to be worth it, I would need to find as much data relating to my topic as possible. After finding the relevant data for my project, I went through the (painful) process of trying to clean up the data to a workable state so that I could import the data into RStudio for visualization and further analysis. I'll admit, some of the datasets were easier to clean than others.
