# Personal Project for DTC 115 - Introduction to Data Analytics
Repository for my personal project for DATA 115 - Introduction to Data Analytics at Washington State University.

I've always been intrigued by the influence of social media on everyday life and how it affects its users longterm. With this project, I set out to find the answer to the question: "What is the most important social media app?" Obviously, though, it's not as easy as you might think to answer a question like that, seeing as there are an insane amount of variables you need to consider.

Acquiring the data for this project was made possible through the use of data.world and their collection of relevant datasets pertaining to social media use in a wide range of settings and audiences. Going in, I knew if I wanted this data analysis to be worth it, I would need to find as much data relating to my topic as possible. After finding the relevant data for my project, I went through the (painful) process of trying to clean up the data to a workable state so that I could import the data into RStudio for analysis and visualization.

The chart above breaks down the overall data by gender, showing the number of responses from each gender and comparing them to each other.

The chart above shows the percentage of choices for each gender. For example, 59.10% of males answering the survey chose Snapchat as the social media platform they care about the most.

The one thing not present in this dataset that upsets me and, in my opinion, throws off the overall data is the absence of Twitter as an option for social media platforms. I believe Twitter to be one of the largest social media platforms and the lack of Twitter as an option would ultimately skew the data towards the second-best social media platform for a lot of the participants of the survey. Unfortunately, in order to reconstruct this survey and poll people would be exceedingly difficult, seeing as you would likely need a rather large pool of respondents in order to give the data any weight/significance; polling, say, 10 people would not be sufficient in attempting to generalize that information to a larger overall population, especially when dealing with some like social media.

The main takeaway from this data is people are much more interested in the traditional social media platforms and are largely more favorable of the platforms that focus on communication, seeing as Snapchat is the clear favorite among the respondents. It appears that not many respondents were enthusiastic to use LinkedIn, or maybe they had no use for it, either due to already having a job or not currently searching for a job.

I think it would have been really interesting to create an interactive graph where you are able to sort the data by the segements present to see which segement answered. However, my skills in that department are lacking, unfortunately.
